# This is a tutorial from freeCodeCamp!

The Mintbean hackathon for this month is to create a game. I didn't feel quite ready to create a game, so I found a tutorial that would take me through the steps.In addition, we haven't covered hooks in my bootcamp, so I thought this tutorial would be a good opportunity to learn hooks as well.

## What I'm learning through this


### Planning

When you jump into React, planning a structure for the app can be a challenge. I like how he uses App.js to outline the components. The outlining process is helping me understand the interrelationship of components a little better.

### Hooks & Styled Components

I've not used hooks or Styled Components yet. This was a great introduction to both of these concepts. I added in a credit component and styled credit component to make sure when I deploy the finished project, credit is given where credit is due. I couldn't figure out quickly how to style a link in styled components without creating a new component or prop just for the link, so I went with a quick inline style to fix that. For whatever reason the board and buttons remained aligned left, so I went ahead and fixed that to center as well. 

### Arrays, Arrays, Arrays

I love how this game runs on arrays. Everything on the internet is either and object or an array (lol. Arrays are objects.). 

## Overall this was a fantastic experience. I can't say I normally learn this much doing a tutorial.
